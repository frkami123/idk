/// unique name for the newly generated c_span. The first generated attempt is just using `c_span{type name}{size
/// type}`, where the size type is only used if ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_SIZE_TYPE is also defined by you. Otherwise, it defaults

/// @remarks This definition is optional. When not provided, the default layout is `{ pointer_type , size_type }`. If
/// this is defined and its value is 1, the layout is `{ size_type, pointer_type }`. This can aid when generating
/// certain types that are meant to be compatible with other kinds of buffers, e.g. with POSIX's `iovec`.
