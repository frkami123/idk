tag_invoke
==========

``tag_invoke`` is a way of doing customization points in Modern C++ that is meant to be easier to work with and less hassle for end-users. It follows the paper `P1895 <https://wg21.link/p1895>`_. A presentation for ``tag_invoke`` that covers its uses and its improvements over the status quo by `Gašper Ažman can be found here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_bijOA1jts>`_.
