to_address
==========

Utility extension point to get the address of either a pointer (which is already an address) or an iterator type (which must be a contiguous iterator).

.. note:: This does not actually check if the iterator is contiguous. It just checks if the input type is either a pointer or something which can be ``operator->()``, which implies it must yield an in-language pointer type eventually.
