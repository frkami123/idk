Progress & Future Work
======================

This is where the status and progress of the library will be kept. You can also check the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/soasis/idk/issues>`_ for specific issues and things being worked on!



Containers
----------

We should work on some spicy containers. Probably.

- ☐ ``fixed_vector`` (``noexcept``-throughout)
- ☐ ``small_vector`` (``noexcept``-throughout)
- ☐ ``vector`` (``noexcept``-throughout)


Allocators
----------

We should release some spicy allocators. Maybe wrap a few of the existing ones.

- ☐ That shiny new Linux allocator everyone was talking about early in the Pandemic
- ☐ ``mimalloc`` (eww)
- ☐ ``jemalloc`` (requires fixing their godawful build system)
