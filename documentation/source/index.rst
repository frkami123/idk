``ztd.idk``
===========

This is the IDK (Industrial Development Kit) library, part of the ZTD collection. The IDK is a small, useful toolbox of supplementary things, including

- The ztd.idk core library:

	- A small collection of type traits, optimizations, and other semi-niche utilities for accelerating development.
	- Small, header-only.
	- CMake: ``ztd::idk`` (also pulls in ``ztd::tag_invoke`` and ``ztd::version``)

- The ztd.tag_invoke customization point library:

	- Modeled after `C++ proposal p1895 <https://wg21.link/p1895>`_.
	- Makes for a single extension point to be written, ``tag_invoke(...)``, whose first argument is the name of the extension point to be hooking into. E.g., ``tag_invoke(tag_t<lua_push>, ...)``.
	- Tiny, header-only.
	- CMake: ``ztd::tag_invoke`` (also pulls in ``ztd::version``)

- The ztd.version configuration macro library:

	- A formalization of the principles found in this post and this post.
	- Mistake-resistant configuration and default-on/off vs. deliberate on/off detection.
	- Infinitesimally tiny, header-only.
	- CMake: ``ztd::version``
