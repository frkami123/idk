Assertions
==========

This API defines 2 assertion macros. One is named ``ZTD_ASSERT``, and the other is named ``ZTD_ASSERT_MESSAGE``. The first takes only one or more conditional tokens, the second takes a mandatory message token as the first parameter, and then one or more conditional parameters.

The user can override the behavior of each of these by defining both of ``ZTD_ASSERT_USER`` and ``ZTD_ASSERT_MESSAGE_USER``.

When :ref:`debug mode is detected<config-ZTD_DEBUG>` and user-defined assertions are not macro-defined, then a default implementation is used. Typically, these:

- check the condition, and if it is true:

  - print (``std::cerr`` or ``fprintf(stderr, ...)``, depending on the language) a message including line, file, etc.; and,
  - exit the program cleanly (``std::terminate`` or ``exit``, depending on the language)

Note that no side-effects should ever go into assertions, because assertions can be compiled to do nothing.
