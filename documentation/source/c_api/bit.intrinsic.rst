Bit Intrinsics
==============

Bit intrinsics are functions that map as closely as possible to behavior and functionality in ISAs without needing to deal with the undefined behavior and non-portability of said architectures. It provides vital functionality that can greatly speed up work on specific kinds of bit operations. The provided intrinsics here are a large subset of the most efficient operations, offered in various flavors for ease-of-use.

"Leading" refers to the most significant bit in a given value. This is the "left side" of an integer when writing source code, such that ``0b10`` has a most significant bit of ``1``. "Trailing" refers to the least significant bit in a given value. This is the "left side" of an integer when writing source code, such that ``0b10`` has a least significant bit of ``0``.
